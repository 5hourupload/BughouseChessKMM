Pawns cannot be place on the 1st or 8th rank. When pawns are promoted and then captured, the piece will revert back to a pawn. The game ends when either board wins. Games can be won either by running out of time, checkmate, or by capturing the king (only possible when playing without checking). Some positions that would be checkmate in traditional chess are not considered checkmate in bughouse, due to the ability to drop pieces anywhere on the board. This does occasionally cause situations where a player is forced to stall. Stalemates are not possible. If a player cannot move a piece already on the board, they must wait for a piece from their teammate. Communication is key between the partners!
